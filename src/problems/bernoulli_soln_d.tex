Because $\SAMPLESIZE{}$ is large and the variance (which is $\NORMALVAR{}$) is greater than 20, we can approximate Bin($\SAMPLESIZE{}$, 0.$\STANFORDRATE{}$) the distribution as Normal, with $\mu$ equal to $\NORMALMEAN{}$ and $\sigma^{2}$ of $\NORMALVAR{}$.  We need to reframe the our $\THRESHOLD{}$ in terms of the number of standard deviations below the estimated mean. \\

Let X represent the number of Stanford undergraduates who hold part-time jobs, and let Y approximate X using $N(\NORMALMEAN{},\NORMALVAR{})$.  That means that:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
P(X > \THRESHOLD{}) &= P(Y > \THRESHOLDCC) \\
                    &= 1 - P(Y < \THRESHOLDCC) \\
                    &= 1 - \Phi(\frac{\THRESHOLDCC - \NORMALMEAN{}}{\NORMALSTD{}}) \\
                    &= 1 - \Phi(-\NORMALZ{}) \\
                    &= \Phi(\NORMALZ{}) \\
                    &= \BERNOULLISOLND{}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
