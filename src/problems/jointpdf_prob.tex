\section{Jointly Continuous Random Variables [10 points]}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
$X$ and $Y$ are jointly continuous random variables with the following joint PDF:

\begin{equation}
f_{X,Y}(x,y) = c(\XVAR{} x^2 + \YVAR{} y) \qquad 0 \leq x\leq \XBOUND{} \text{ and } 0 \leq y \leq \YBOUND{}
\end{equation}

Note that $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$ is a valid PDF if the constant $c = \CONST{}$. What is $E[Y]$? Provide a numeric answer (fractions are fine).
