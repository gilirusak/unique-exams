\section{Video Views: Binomial Approximation [10 points]}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We are studying a video streaming platform. We define a viewer for a particular video as a user who watches the video in entirety. Let the number of viewers for each video be distributed as a Binomial random variable $\text{Bin}(n, p)$, where $n$ is the initial number of viewers and $p$ is the probability that each initial viewer watches the entire video.

Suppose that the number of viewers for a popular video $A$ is distributed as $\text{Bin}(\NA{}, \PA{})$. Furthermore, suppose that the number of viewers for a not-so-popular video $B$ is distributed as $\text{Bin}(\NB{}, \PB{})$. What is the \textbf{approximate} probability that the number of viewers for video $A$ is \textbf{more than twice} the number of viewers for video $B$?
