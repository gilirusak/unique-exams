\item 


We are studying a video streaming platform. Suppose that the number of viewers for a popular video $A$ is distributed as a binomial $X \sim Bin(\NA{}, \PA{})$. 

Further, suppose that the number of viewers for a not-so-popular video $B$ is distriubted as $Y \sim Bin(\NB{}, \PB{})$.

What is the \textbf{approximate} probability that the number of viewers for video $A$ is \textbf{more than twice} the number of viewers for video $B$?
