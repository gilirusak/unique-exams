Let $D$ be the total data downloaded (in MB) across all users who visit the homepage in a minute. If $V$ is the number of visitors in that minute (where $V\sim\Poi(\lambda = \FISHRATE{})$), then $D = \FISHSCALE{}V$. Therefore by linearity of expectation, $E[D] = E[\FISHSCALE{}V] = \FISHSCALE{}E[V] = \FISHSCALE{}(\FISHRATE{}) = \FISHPROD{}$.
