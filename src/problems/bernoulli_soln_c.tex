Let BB represent the event that both undergraduates attend Berkeley, and let WW represent the event that both undergraduates work.
First, we compute the probability that both undergraduates attend Berkeley, which is relatively easy compared to the other probabilities we need to compute: $P(BB) = {\frac{33000}{40000} \cdot \frac{32999}{39999}} = 0.680621$. (That's the value assuming no replacement.  However, because the problem didn't explicitly state that, we're content accepting answers that assumed replacement.  In that case, $ P(BB) = {(\frac{33000}{40000})^{2}} = 0.680625$.  Not surprisingly, the numbers are nearly indistiguishable.) \\

The probability that both undergraduates work given they each attend Berkeley is even easier, because it's the same regardless of replacement strategy: $P(WW | BB) = {{0.\BERKELEYRATE}^{2}} = \BERNOULLISOLNCPROBBOTHBERKWORK$. \\ 

Now, computing the probability that both randomly chosen students work is only slightly more involved: $P(WW) = P(WW|BB)\,P(BB) + P(WW|BS)\,P(BS) + P(WW|SB)\,P(SB) + P(WW|SS)\,P(SS)$.  This is involved enough that we should derive it:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
P(WW) &= P(BB)\,P(WW|BB) + P(BS)\,P(WW|BS) + P(SB)\,P(WW|SB) + P(SS)\,P(WW|SS) \\
      &= P(BB)\,P(WW|BB) + 2 \cdot P(BS)\,P(WW|BS) + P(SS)\,P(WW|SS) \\
      &= {\frac{33000}{40000} \frac{32999}{39999}} \cdot {{0.\BERKELEYRATE}^{2}} + 2 \cdot \frac{33000}{40000}\frac{7000}{39999} \cdot {0.\BERKELEYRATE} \cdot {0.\STANFORDRATE} + {\frac{7000}{40000}\frac{6999}{39999}} \cdot {{0.\STANFORDRATE}^{2}} \\
      &= \BERNOULLISOLNCPROBBOTHWORK
\end{split}    
\end{equation*}

This, Stanford students, is classic Bayes Theorem.

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
P(BB|WW) \cdot P(WW) &= P(WW|BB) \cdot P(BB) \\
P(BB|WW)  &= \frac{P(WW|BB) \cdot P(BB)}{P(WW)} \\
          &= \frac{\BERNOULLISOLNCPROBBOTHBERKWORK{} \cdot 0.680621}{\BERNOULLISOLNCPROBBOTHWORK{}} \\
          &= \BERNOULLISOLNCWITHOUT{}
\end{split}    
\end{equation*}

The above derivation assumes no replacement.  With replacement, $P(BB|WW) = \BERNOULLISOLNCWITH{}$.  Not surprisingly, the two probabilities are very, very close.
