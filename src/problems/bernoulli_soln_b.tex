The probability that we need to interview $\NTRIALS{}$ Stanford undergraduates before we finally find $\NSUCCESSES{}$ students who hold part-time jobs is given by:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
P(S_{\NSUCCESSES{}} = \NTRIALS{}) &= \binom{\NTRIALS{} - 1}{\NSUCCESSES{} - 1} \cdot (0.\STANFORDRATE)^{\NSUCCESSES{}} \cdot (0.\STANFORDRATECOMP)^{\NTRIALS{} - \NSUCCESSES{}} \\
                                  &= \BERNOULLISOLNB{}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
