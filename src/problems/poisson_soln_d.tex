Using the definitions of $D$ and $V$ as in part (c), we are looking to compute $P(D = \FISHNUM) = P(\FISHSCALE{}V = \FISHNUM) = P(V = \FISHEQUIV)$. Since $V\sim\Poi(\FISHRATE{})$,

\[P(D = \FISHNUM) = P(V = \FISHEQUIV{}) = \dfrac{\FISHRATE{}^{\FISHEQUIV{}} e^{-\FISHRATE{}}}{\FISHEQUIV{}!} \approx \FISHDATAPROB{}.\]

Note that we cannot model $D$ as a Poisson random variable, because $D$ can only take on non-negative values that are multiples of $\FISHSCALE{}$ and not the entire range of support of a typical Poisson (non-negative integers).
